# Work Breakdown Agreements (WBA)

# Assignment 1
| Responsibility | Owner |
| ------ | ------ |
| Pushing all Diagrams on GIT | Suchit |
| Drawing Diagrams (Class Diagram, Interaction Diagram) | Suchit & Kamal |
| Writing all documents using shared Google doc (WBA, Design Rationale & Responsibilities of the classes)| Suchit & Kamal |
| Pushing all written documents .md format | Kamal |

> Note: Owner is the person who will work on the task described in the column
> named 'Responsibility'

## Reviewing The Deliverables
- Suchit will review all the written documents before Kamal pushes them to GIT Lab


- Kamal will review all the diagrams before Suchit pushes them to GIT lab


## Dates by which the deliverables need to be completed
- Everything should be completed and pushed to our GIT repository
  at least 2 days before the due date(21/04 or 22/04), provided all reviews are done.


- Half of the task should be done at least 1 week before due date (16/04 or 17/04),
  it's fine if the reviews are not completed at that time
  (i.e., not yet pushed to the GIT repository). The person responsible for the task needs to inform
  his partner that the task is 50% completed and needs to be reviewed.


>Note:
All review dates are subject to change due to workload of other units,
but the reviews will always be done before pushing to our GIT repository

## Details of how the reviews would be carried out
> All the written documents are first written on our shared drive.
> Once we finish our discussion, Kamal will write the design rationale in
> a shared Google doc file and Suchit will review the work occasionally, before
> Kamal proceeds to write the md file and commits the diagram to our GIT repository.


> Likewise, we will discuss how the diagrams shall look like and the relationships
> between the classes/interfaces. Suchit will then proceed to draw it on LucidChart which
> will also be a shared file and Kamal will be able to review the diagrams before Suchit
> commits the diagram to our GIT repository.


## Mode of communication
We will use WhatsApp and Zoom to communicate.
Zoom will mostly be used when we need to work together on a particular task,
while WhatsApp will be used to discuss other matters that can be handled via messages.

## Reviewing The Deliverables

Before pushing the code on Git, the owner of the tasks will do all necessary testing and update the documentation.
The person will then inform the other member that codes are in the repository.
The other member will then review code and see if itâ€™s in accordance with the documentation. 
If there are any issues, he will then inform the owner and can set up a meeting if needed.


## Dates by which the deliverables need to be completed

- Half of the tasks by each member should be completed by next Monday (03/05/2021) and pushed to our GIT repository.
  
- Everything should be finalised at least one day before the due date (07/05/2021)


## Mode of communication

Zoom will be used to conduct code reviews.
Everything else is same as how we did for Assignment 1

#### Note:
> To implement all functionalities for the dinosaur related classes, these new classes
> were created as a helper: BreedingBehaviour, LocateFoodBehaviour & UnconciousBehaviour.

> For easier implementation for the action involving vending machine, the interface: VendingMachineItemsInterface 
> was added.
